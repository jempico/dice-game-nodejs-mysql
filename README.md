Rest API that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) documents in MySQL.

Things I've learned
- Encrypt user passwords with "bcrypt".
- Authenticate users in a login route with JSON web token.
- Add nested collection to a User model using the "populate" method.
- Use middleware for mongoose model or express routes to check if there is a valid token that matches the user's id before saving data.
