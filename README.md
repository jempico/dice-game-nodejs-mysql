A REST API that can create, read, update and delete data (CRUD OPERATIONS) on MySQL.

## Installation:
1. Run SQL file (dicegame_restapi.sql which is located in 'src > scripts' folder) locally. You can use MySQL Workbench for this purpose. This will create a database called "dicegame".
2. Change environment variables in the .env file, with your local host (usually 'localhost') user (usually 'root') and password.
3. Run the program (type 'node app' in your terminal).
